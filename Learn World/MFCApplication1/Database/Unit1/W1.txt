Dear Sir/Madam,
I am writing this letter in order to complain about a car that I rented from your agency recently. When I collected it from your city branch, I noticed clouds of smoke coming from the exhaust pipe. I told your representative that I required a dependable vehicle as I would be making a long journey, and he assured me that I would not have any mechanical difficulties with it. However,as soon as I took it for a longer trip it broke down, leaving me stranded 200 kilometers from the nearest town. To make matters worse, the air conditioning stopped working as well.
Consequently, after several hours of waiting, first for help and then for repairs, I had to drive on in the summer heat. Since I rented this car on your representative’s advice, I feel that I am entitled to request a full refund. I can be contacted at the address or phone number provided. I would greatly appreciate your prompt resolution of this matter.
Yours faithfully,
Jamie Wang
