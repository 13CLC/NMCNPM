I’m going to talk about my ideal place to relax and also a famous tourist attraction in Vietnam, Sapa. 
Among various reasons, i love Sapa simply ‘cause of people there. They are warm, kind hearted and trustworthy. 
I remember that summer when my family decided to have a holiday in Sapa, we came into trouble ‘cause it was a tourist season and we ran out of hotels. Fortuanately, we were put in by a local person for a night and she found a hotel nearby for us the following morning. 
Besides people. i found in Sapa many interesting places to play and learn about the ethnic minorities in Vietnam that I just had a chance to see in textbooks and on TV.
Therefore, I see Sapa as a beautiful and peaceful place for me to refresh myself and recharge my battery after an assiduous semester.
Anyway, i will come back to Sapa next summer for sure.
